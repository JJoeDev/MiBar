Explore better options for file parser in configManager
- If better alternative is found switch
- It should be less verbose
- It should handle comments
- It should be easier to implement in bar.cpp

- Target config file (This format can change from this initial idea) {

    Bar:Bar
    foreground = FFFFFFFF // AA-RR-GG-BB
    background = FF282828

    width = 1900
    height = 30

    x = 10
    y = 3

    Module:Text
    string = Hello World // Single line comment
    foreground = FFFF0000 // AA-RR-GG-BB
    background = FF000000

    ==== ALTERNATIVE LOOK IN CONSIDERATION ====

    @Bar
    foreground = FFFFFFFF // AA-RR-GG-BB
    background = FF282828

    width = 1900
    height = 30

    x = 10
    y = 3

    @Text
    string = Hello World // Single line comment
    foreground = FFFF0000 // AA-RR-GG-BB
    background = FF000000

Explore modules to add
- High priority at the moment
- - Bspwm workspace integration (my wm of choice)
- - clock

General configuration
- Placement (Right, Center, Left)
- More advanced colors (gradients)
- Size stuff (modules should set default size to bar - some amount (should be able to override))
